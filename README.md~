malware_inspector
=================

The python script takes advantage of VirusTotal API and Team Cymru services to find any malicious process or the file/directory on the system and sends an e-mail alert if any malware is found.
The main features are:
* Monitors all the running processes for malicious activities using Virustotal(https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/) and TeamCymru(http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR/)
* Sends an e-mail when any malicious process/file/directory is detected.

A big thanks to both Virustotal and Team Cymru teams for providing such wonderful services that allows checking of malicious contents.

For convenience,the scripts are divided in two parts: Process monitor and file/directory monitor

* Process monitor - Checks all the running processes against Virustotal and Team Cymru's malware hashes
* File/directory monitor - Checks the file or directory against Virustotal and Team Cymru's malware hashes

Installation

The code has been tested on CentOS distribution but should work on other platforms like Windows without any issue.
